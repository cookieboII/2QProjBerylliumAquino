  <div id="def">
    <p>
    Gender refers to the characteristics of people that society views as feminine, masculine, and anything in 
    between or beyond. This includes gender roles, clothing, expected behaviors, and more. Most of these expectations 
    can harm people's mental, emotional, and physical health as these force people into a very tiny box that people can 
    find uncomfortable to be in.
    </br></br>
    Contrary to popular belief, gender is an extremely broad spectrum, not a binary classification. One can identify at 
    any point in this spectrum or outside of it entirely. 
    </br></br>
    Although connected, sex and gender are different.
    </br></br>
    Sex is the label a doctor gives someone the moment they are born - usually. A person can be male, female, or 
    intersex when born. Sex is based on one's hormones, genes, and genitalia. Meanwhile, gender is how society wants 
    persons to look, think, and act based on one's femininity and masculinity. 
    </p>

    <h1>Sexual Orientation</h1>
    <p>Sexual orientation refers to what gender/s a person is attracted to. This can change over time, and a person 
    isn't obligated to put labels on their sexual orientation. Here are the commonly described sexual orientations:</p>
    
    <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 3.8em; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0em; font-size: 4vh;">
        <li>Heterosexuality</li>
        <li>Homosexuality</li>
        <li>Bisexuality</li>
        <li>Pansexuality</li>
        <li>Asexuality</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <p>Note that these are NOT the only sexual orientations that exist. Most of these are umbrella terms for more 
      specific and inclusive sexual orientations.
      </p>

    <hr></hr>
    
    <h1>Gender Identity</h1>
    <p>Gender identity refers to how masculine or feminine a person is. Some people's gender identity is pretty much the 
    same as their assigned sex at birth; these people are called cisgender. Some feel like their gender is of the 
    opposite sex; they are transmen or transwomen. Some people's gender identity does not fit with the binary sexes; 
    these people are, mostly, non-binaries. Some do not even want to label themselves. Gender is a spectrum, so people 
    should not be boxed into these labels.</p>

    <hr></hr>

    <h1>Gender Expression</h1>
    <p>Gender expression is how a person publicly expresses their gender. They could be masculine, feminine, or anything 
    in between. Remember that if a person presents themselves as someone that doesn't fit the social norms for the 
    gender of that person, that does not automatically indicate that the person is of a different gender. For example, 
    if a cis girl wears masculine clothing and her hair is cut short, it does not automatically mean that the girl is a 
    transman. ALWAYS remember to ask for one's pronouns and gender from time-to-time as to not misgender them as much as 
    possible.</p>
